X-crawl Philosophy : 


How development happens :

- Anyone with commit access may modify the repository to their desire.
- Contributors without commit access may propose ideas and have them be voted on. (If the idea is NOT antithetical to the design philosophy)
- A version plan must be made after each successive release to have a certain and true direction for development.
- The planned features from the version plan may be implemented without a vote.
- Anything that doesn't work well may be reverted.
- Purely beneficial changes which largely do not affect gameplay (e.g UI changes, bug fixes, vaults) will be merged into X-Crawl from the main Crawl repository without a vote.

Guiding Principle :

"A player, having played both DCSS and X-Crawl over a significant and varied number of games, must feel that X-crawl provides a meaningfully different experience from the base game."

Restraints : 

- No major development decisions should be based purely on 'flavour'.
- Gameplay, as a minimum, must be more challenging than Vanilla Crawl
- Purely random phenomena should not decide whether a particular run ends or not.
- When possible, Overall player strength should not be increased.
- The player is not allowed to have an advantage where the only downside is boredom.


Desirable, but not required, design goals : 

- High replayability (either through species, backgrounds, gods, branches etc.)
- Re-works of existing content is more desirable than adding new content, when possible.
